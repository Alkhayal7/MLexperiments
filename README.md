# Machine Learning Experiments

Repository to support my course (EE-482) at ECE, King Abdulaziz University, KSA. 

Example codes to help understand the mathematics and logic behind Gradient Descent Algorithm, Linear/Non-Linear/Logistic Regression and other fundamental ML techniques.

Most of the source codes are for Matlab environment. Some have been translated for Python by students.
